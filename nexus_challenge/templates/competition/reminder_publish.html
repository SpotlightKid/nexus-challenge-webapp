Hello {{ user.username }},

your competition entry submitted on **{{ entry.created_on.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC') }}** is
still unpublished. To enter the competition, you *must publish* your entry *before the deadline*
on **{{ deadline.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC') }}**!

Your entry:

**Title:** *{{ entry.title }}*<br/>
**Artist:** *{{ entry.artist }}*<br/>
**URL:** [{{ entry.url }}]({{ entry.url }})

You can review and publish the entry at [{{ entry_url }}]({{ entry_url }}) (you need to sign in).

After publication, your entry must be approved by the competition organizer before it is listed on
the site and can be voted on. As long as your entry is published before the deadline, it will enter
the competition, even if the approval happens after the deadline.
