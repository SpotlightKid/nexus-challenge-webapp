Ideas for 2020 Challenge
------------------------

* Look Ma, no drums!
* Given musical motive (snippet) has to be used
* Musical rounds (react to to somebody's track). But difficult for timing.
* Cooperation (each submission must be by at least 2 artists cooperating)
* A set of instrument und effects (plugins) has to be used.

  It's like the One Synth Challenge only more strict
  (because effects are also limited to a given set).

  An example: "fluid3 soundfont and calf plugins".

  Sequencer / DAW can be chosen freely so long as they are Open Source.
* Only allow Open Source DAWs next year?

Possible Ways of Handling Voting Statistics / Trends:
-----------------------------------------------------

E = Everybody
U = Registered users
V = Voters
C = Competition entrants


1. No statistics or trends shown to anybody until voting is over

2a. C can see total score of each track (i.e. score board at that point in time)
2b. C can see total score of own track
2c. C can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)
2d. C can see how often own track has been voted for (but not points per vote)

3a. V can see total score of each track
3b. V can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)

4a. U can see total score of each track
4b. U can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)

5a. E can see total score of each track
5b. E can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)
